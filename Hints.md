# Hints

Hints let us make decisions which are made by the oracle optimizer. 
As a developer, we know our data better than optimizer. 
Hints provide a mechanism to instruct the optimizer to choose a certain query execution plan based on the specific criteria.

Some of the important hints are all_rows,first_rows,choose,rule,hash, index,full, index_join, rewrite and parallel.
